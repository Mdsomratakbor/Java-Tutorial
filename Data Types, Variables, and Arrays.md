### 1. Why is Java a platform independent language?
`Java language was developed in such a way that it does not depend on any hardware or software due to the fact that the compiler compiles the code and then converts it to platform-independent byte code which can be run on multiple systems.`

 - The only condition to run that byte code is for the machine to have a runtime environment (JRE) installed in it.
### 2. How many data types in Java?
**There are two types of data type in java**

- **1. Primitive data types:** `The primitive data types include boolean, char, byte, short, int, long, float and double`.
- **2. Non-primitive data types:** `The non-primitive data types include Classes, Interfaces, and Arrays.`

### 3. What is Scope and Lifetime of Variables in Java?

- Java allows variables to be declared within any block.
- A block is begun with an opening curly bracket and ended by a closing curly bracket. A block defines a scope.
- A scope determines what objects are visible to other parts of your program. 
- It also determines the lifetime of those objects.
- Scopes can be nested.
- Variables are created when their scope is entered, and destroyed when their scope is left.
- The lifetime of a variable is confined to its scope.
