### 1. Why is Java a platform independent language?
`Java language was developed in such a way that it does not depend on any hardware or software due to the fact that the compiler compiles the code and then converts it to platform-independent byte code which can be run on multiple systems.`

 - The only condition to run that byte code is for the machine to have a runtime environment (JRE) installed in it.
### 2. How many data types in Java?
**There are two types of data type in java**

- **1. Primitive data types:** `The primitive data types include boolean, char, byte, short, int, long, float and double`.
- **2. Non-primitive data types:** `The non-primitive data types include Classes, Interfaces, and Arrays.`
